Data Science Projects by Roberto Jackson Baeza

In this project is the coding and reports for my Data Science Course.
To prevent academic dishonesty I am not including the project descriptions.
Task 1-4 were all coded and completed by me alone.
The Group Project was completed alongside three great classmates of mine, listed in the report. For the project I was in charge of developing the algorithm for method 2 in section 1.4, and coding the visualizations shown in sections 2.2 and 2.3
